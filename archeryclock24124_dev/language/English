1 archer per target.
1 archer per turn 2 turns per end
1 archer per turn 3 turns per end
1 archer per turn 4 turns per end
2 archers per turn 2 turns per end Get arrows after every end
2 archers per turn 2 X 2 turns per end. (Get arrows after every 2 ends). Typically used on long distances where 6 arrows are shot before getting the arrows. But in this case still 3 arrows in 2 minutes.
2 archers per turn 2 turns per end shooting 6 arrows in a row in 4 minutes. So every end has 6 arrows. Practice is only 1 end of 6 arrows.
